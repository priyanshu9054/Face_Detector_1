# Face_Detector_1
It scans your face and saves it, than your picture runs through deep learning process in an algorithm and than that algorithm will predict your face.
It uses LBPHFaceRecognizer algorithm.
This repository provides a simple introduction to face detection in Python using OpenCV.

What is Face Detection?

Face detection is the process of identifying human faces in images and videos. It has a wide range of applications, from security and surveillance to entertainment and social media.

This Basic Face Detector:

Utilizes OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library, for face detection.
Identifies and draws bounding boxes around detected faces in images.
Provides a starting point for exploring more advanced face detection techniques.
Requirements:

Python 3.6+
OpenCV libraries:
Install OpenCV through your package manager or download pre-built binaries from https://opencv.org/releases/.
Make sure you install the OpenCV contrib modules for face detection capabilities (e.g., pip install opencv-contrib-python).
Structure:

The repository includes:

main.py: Main script for face detection
README.md: This file (what you're reading now)
haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: Pre-trained face detection model (included in OpenCV contrib modules)
Running the Script:

Save the code from main.py as a separate file (e.g., face_detector.py).
Run the script: python face_detector.py path/to/image.jpg (replace path/to/image.jpg with the actual image path).
The script will display the original image with bounding boxes around detected faces.
Example Output:

Further Enhancements:

Implement real-time face detection using webcams.
Combine face detection with facial recognition for identifying specific individuals.
Explore deeper learning-based face detection models for higher accuracy.
Customization:

Feel free to customize the script to suit your needs. You can adjust parameters like:

Minimum face size for detection
Confidence threshold for filtering false positives
Color and thickness of bounding boxes
Additional Resources:

OpenCV Face Detection Documentation: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html
PyImage tutorial for drawing bounding boxes: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageDraw.html
This is a basic setup, and you can delve deeper into the fascinating world of computer vision and face detection to build even more sophisticated applications.

Remember:

OpenCV installation varies depending on your platform. Follow the official documentation for detailed instructions.
Download and place the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file in the same directory as your script.
